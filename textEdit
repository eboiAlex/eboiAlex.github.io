Don't get me venting on friends who resent you 'Cause all you've ever done is been a noose to hang on to They thought was a necklace and reckless they fell into hell Where you both hang with nothing to do but` ;

  //The choice of replacing 'devil' with 'stranger' almost the lyrics feel more innocent. As the song is about a person trying to justify their own toxic behavior, and blame everyone but himself for being alone. By him talking to a stranger they can come off as almost justified in blaming his friends for leaving him. To reflect this change in tone we chose a light blue to invoke tranquility, and a more fluid text. However, when you reveal the original text the font and background color becomes aggressive.
